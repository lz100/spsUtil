# spsUtil

The {[systemPipeShiny](https://github.com/systemPipeR/systemPipeShiny)} (SPS) framework comes with many useful utility functions. 
However, installing the whole framework is heavy and takes some time. If you 
like only a few useful utility functions from SPS, install this package is enough. 

## Install

```r
if (!requireNamespace("spsUti", quietly=TRUE))
    remotes::install_github("lz100/spsUti")
```
