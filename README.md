The {[systemPipeShiny](https://github.com/systemPipeR/systemPipeShiny)} (SPS) framework comes with many useful utility functions. 
However, installing the whole framework is heavy and takes some time. If you 
like only a few useful utility functions from SPS, install this package is enough. 

## Install

Install release version from CRAN:

```r
install.packages("spsUtil")
```

Develop version:

```r
if (!requireNamespace("spsUtil", quietly=TRUE))
    remotes::install_github("lz100/spsUtil")
```

## User manual
